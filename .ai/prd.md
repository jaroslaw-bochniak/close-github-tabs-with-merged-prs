# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Close Merged GitHub Tabs

## 1. Product Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a browser extension named "Close Merged GitHub Tabs". The extension is designed for software developers and anyone working with GitHub who wants to maintain a clean and efficient browser workspace. By clicking a single button in the browser toolbar, the user can automatically find and close all open tabs in their current browser window that contain already merged GitHub Pull Requests. The core goal is to provide a simple, "fire-and-forget" utility that reduces tab clutter and minimizes manual, repetitive actions.

## 2. User Problem

Developers and project managers often have numerous browser tabs open simultaneously, many of which are GitHub Pull Requests (PRs) they are reviewing, tracking, or have authored. Once a PR is merged into the main branch, its corresponding tab is no longer immediately relevant for action but frequently remains open. This leads to several problems:

- Tab Clutter: An accumulation of unnecessary tabs makes it difficult to navigate to and focus on current, relevant tasks.
- Cognitive Load: A disorganized workspace increases mental overhead, forcing the user to periodically stop their work to manually sift through and close old tabs.
- Resource Consumption: Each open tab consumes system memory and CPU, and having many open can degrade browser performance.

Manually identifying which PRs have been merged and closing them one by one is a tedious, time-consuming, and distracting process that interrupts development workflow.

## 3. Functional Requirements

- FR-001: The extension must provide an icon in the browser's toolbar that serves as the single point of interaction.
- FR-002: A single click on the toolbar icon must initiate the process of scanning and closing tabs.
- FR-003: The scan must be limited to the tabs within the currently active browser window.
- FR-004: The extension must identify potential Pull Request tabs by checking if their URL contains the string `/pull/`.
- FR-005: For each identified PR tab, the extension must inject a content script to analyze the DOM and determine the PR's status.
- FR-006: A PR is considered "Merged" if the page's DOM contains a specific element indicating this state (e.g., a `<span>` with `title="Status: Merged"` or a specific CSS class like `State--merged`).
- FR-007: All tabs confirmed to be "Merged" must be closed automatically.
- FR-008: The extension must not close browser tabs that are pinned by the user, regardless of their content.
- FR-009: No confirmation dialog shall be shown to the user before closing the tabs.
- FR-010: If an error occurs while checking a specific tab (e.g., page failed to load, script injection failed), that tab must be skipped, and the process should continue with the remaining tabs.
- FR-011: To prevent performance degradation, the extension must process tabs in small, sequential batches (e.g., 5-10 tabs at a time).
- FR-012: The extension must request the minimum necessary permissions during installation, specifically for accessing tab information and executing scripts on GitHub pages.

## 4. Project Scope

### In Scope

- Development of a browser extension for Google Chrome and compatible Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Opera, Edge).
- Core functionality is strictly limited to identifying and closing tabs of merged GitHub PRs.
- Operation is confined to the user's active browser window.
- Ignoring pinned tabs to prevent accidental closure of important pages.
- A minimalist user interface consisting only of a toolbar icon.

### Out of Scope

- A settings or options page for user configuration.
- Official support for non-Chromium browsers (e.g., Firefox, Safari).
- Functionality to close tabs in any browser window other than the active one.
- A progress indicator, summary report, or any notifications about the operation.
- Support for closing PRs with other statuses, such as "Closed" (without being merged) or "Draft".
- Handling complex authentication scenarios for private repositories beyond the user's existing browser session.

## 5. User Stories

### US-001

- ID: US-001
- Title: Close Merged Pull Request Tabs
- Description: As a developer, I want to click a single button to automatically close all my open tabs for GitHub pull requests that have been merged, so I can quickly clean up my workspace and focus on my current tasks.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  1.  Given I have multiple browser tabs open in my current window, including GitHub PRs that are "merged", "open", and "closed", as well as other non-GitHub websites.
  2.  When I click the extension's toolbar icon.
  3.  Then all tabs corresponding to the "merged" GitHub PRs are closed.
  4.  And all tabs for "open" PRs, "closed" PRs, and other websites remain open.

### US-002

- ID: US-002
- Title: Ignore Pinned Tabs
- Description: As a developer, I want the extension to ignore my pinned tabs, even if they show a merged PR, so that I don't accidentally close tabs that I have intentionally kept for reference.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  1.  Given I have a pinned browser tab that displays a merged GitHub PR.
  2.  And I have at least one un-pinned tab that also displays a merged GitHub PR.
  3.  When I click the extension's toolbar icon.
  4.  Then the un-pinned merged PR tab is closed.
  5.  And the pinned merged PR tab remains open.

### US-003

- ID: US-003
- Title: Operate on Current Window Only
- Description: As a user who organizes work across multiple browser windows, I want the extension to only affect the tabs in the window where I click the icon, giving me precise control over which context I am cleaning up.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  1.  Given I have two browser windows open, Window A and Window B.
  2.  And both windows contain tabs with merged GitHub PRs.
  3.  When I click the extension's toolbar icon in Window A.
  4.  Then only the merged PR tabs in Window A are closed.
  5.  And all tabs in Window B remain unchanged.

### US-004

- ID: US-004
- Title: Handle Page Load Errors Gracefully
- Description: As a user, if a browser tab is unresponsive or has an error, I want the extension to skip that tab and continue its work, so that a single problematic page doesn't prevent the cleanup of other tabs.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  1.  Given I have several tabs with merged PRs open.
  2.  And one of these tabs is in a failed-to-load or error state.
  3.  When I click the extension's toolbar icon.
  4.  Then the extension attempts to check the problematic tab, fails gracefully, and skips it.
  5.  And all other valid merged PR tabs are successfully closed.
  6.  And the problematic tab is left open in its error state.

### US-005

- ID: US-005
- Title: Process a Large Number of Tabs Efficiently
- Description: As a user who often has a very large number of tabs open, I want the extension to process them without freezing or crashing my browser, ensuring a smooth and reliable experience.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  1.  Given I have a large number of tabs open (50+).
  2.  When I click the extension's toolbar icon.
  3.  Then the browser UI remains responsive and usable while the extension is processing.
  4.  And the extension processes tabs in batches to avoid resource exhaustion.

### US-006

- ID: US-006
- Title: Request Necessary Permissions on Installation
- Description: As a security-conscious user, I want the extension to clearly request only the permissions it absolutely needs to function when I install it, so I can trust it is not overstepping its boundaries.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  1.  Given I am installing the extension from the official web store.
  2.  Then I am prompted by the browser to approve a set of permissions.
  3.  And the permissions are limited to what is required for accessing tab URLs and executing scripts on the `github.com` domain.

## 6. Success Metrics

- Primary Metric: Weekly Active Users (WAU). A steady or growing number of WAU indicates that the extension provides continuous value and has been successfully adopted by its target audience.
- Secondary Metric: Average Tabs Closed per Use. Tracking the average number of tabs closed each time the extension is activated. A higher number suggests the extension is effectively solving a significant "tab clutter" problem for its users.
- Quality Metric: Web Store Rating. The average user rating in the Chrome Web Store should be 4.5 stars or higher, indicating high user satisfaction.
- Performance Metric: Error Rate. The percentage of executions that complete without any unhandled exceptions. This should be below 0.1% to ensure the extension is stable and reliable.
